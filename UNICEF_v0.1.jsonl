DO:  speak accurately about the risk from COVID-19, based on scientific data and latest official health advice DON’T:  repeat or share unconfirmed rumours, and avoid using hyperbolic language designed to generate fear like “plague”, “apocalypse” etc. DO:  talk positively and emphasise the importance of effective prevention measures, including following our tips on handwashing.
