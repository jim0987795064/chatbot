Now and always during cold and flu season, stay home if you are sick. Encourage those you know are sick to stay home until they no longer have symptoms. Since respiratory viruses, such as the one that causes COVID-19, are spread through contact, change how you greet one another. Instead of a handshake, a kiss or a hug, a friendly wave or elbow bump is less likely to expose you to respiratory viruses. Practise frequent hygiene, which includes proper hand washing and coughing and sneezing etiquette. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces, such as toys and door handles. These are the most important ways that you can protect yourself and your family from respiratory illness, including COVID-19. \nMake a plan\nIf COVID-19 becomes common in your community, you will want to have thought about how to change your behaviours and routines to reduce the risk of infection.\nYour plan should include how you can change your regular habits to reduce your exposure to crowded places. For example, you may:\n\ndo your grocery shopping at off-peak hours\ncommute by public transit outside of the busy rush hour\nopt to exercise outdoors instead of in an indoor fitness class\n\nYour plan should also include what you will do if you become sick. If you are a caregiver of children or other dependents, you will want to have thought ahead to engage backup caregivers.\nYou should also think about what you will do if a member of your family becomes sick and needs care. Talk to your employer about working from home if you are needed to care for a family member at home.\nIf you become ill, stay home until you are no longer showing symptoms. Employers should not require a sick leave note as that will put added pressure on limited health care services.\nYour plan should include shopping for supplies that you should have on hand at all times. This will ensure you do not need to leave your home while you are sick or busy caring for an ill family member.\nYour plan should build on the kits you have prepared for other potential emergencies. For more information on how to prepare yourself and your family in the event of an emergency, please visit GetPrepared.ca.\n \nFill your prescriptions\nRefill your prescriptions now so that you do not have to go to a busy pharmacy if you do become sick. Consider seeing your health care provider to renew your prescriptions ahead of time.\n \nStock up on essentials but avoid panic buying\nAt this time, it makes sense to fill your cupboards with non-perishable food items, so that you do not need to go shopping if you become sick.\nIt is easier on the supply chain if people gradually build up their household stores instead of making large-scale purchases all at once. To do this, you can add a few extra items to your grocery cart every time you shop. Good options are easy-to-prepare foods like:\n\ndried pasta and sauce\nprepared canned soups\ncanned vegetables and beans\n\nIt is also a good idea to have extra stores of:\n\npet food\ntoilet paper\nfacial tissue\nfeminine hygiene products\ndiapers (if you have children who use them)\n\nThe reason for stocking up on these items is not necessarily because you will need to self-isolate. Having these supplies on hand will ensure you do not need to leave your home at the peak of the outbreak or if you become ill.\n \nHow to care for those who are ill\nIf you or a member of your family become ill with COVID-19, there are precautions that should be taken in the home. Your health care provider will advise you if hospital care is more appropriate. \nChildren who have mild COVID-19 symptoms are able to stay at home with a caregiver throughout their recovery without needing hospitalization. If you are caring for a child who has suspected or probable COVID-19, it is important to follow the advice for caregivers. This advice will help you protect yourself, others in your home, as well as others in the community.\nTo prepare for these potential situations, you should have on hand:\n\nsoap\nfacial tissue\npaper towels\nalcohol-based hand sanitizer\nhousehold cleaning products\nregular detergents for washing dishes and doing laundry\nfever-reducing medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen\r\n      \nthis includes products for children if you are a parent or caregiver\n\n\nplastic garbage bags for containing soiled tissues and other waste\ndiluted bleach, prepared according to the instructions on the label, or in a ratio of 1 teaspoon (5 mL) per cup (250 mL)\r\n      \nthis assumes bleach is 5% sodium hypochlorite, to give a 0.1% sodium hypochlorite solution\n\n\n\n \nGet reliable information\nMake sure that you get high-quality information about COVID-19 from reliable sources.
