Staying home and avoiding all non-essential contact with others continues to be the most important thing all of us can do to stay healthy and keep\nothers healthy.\nMedical masks should be reserved for health care providers who are on the front lines working with patients who are most likely to have COVID-19.\nPeople who are ill with fever and a cough might have a cold, the flu or any number of other diseases, or they may have COVID-19. They should wear a surgical mask to prevent the spread of COVID-19 germs to others. \nNever put a mask or face covering on an infant or an adult that is not able to adjust or remove the mask themselves. This could compromise their ability to breath.\nFor more information: Oregon Guidance on Use of Homemade Masks or Face Coveringsby the Public to Prevent Spread of COVID-19​", "ID": "Oregon Public Health Division|||-9178766110793010434", "answerContainsURLs": false, "answerToks2URL": {}, "questionUUID": "59fdb6c4-961f-11ea-a4d8-0af24cbcf56f", "answerUUID": "59fdb6c5-961f-11ea-a4d8-0af24cbcf56f", "dateLastChanged": 1589487198.5238323}
